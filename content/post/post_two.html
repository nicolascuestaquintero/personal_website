<p>Microsoft Power BI is the current leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence, and one of its main features is its capability for reading both R and Python code. But here is the thing, usually R plots remain as static images and lack of interactivity. Say, you want to know a point in an R scatter plot what value represents exactly. In R, you can use plotly to add this characteristic to your graphs but using plotly with Power BI default R code compiler leads to an error. The aim of this post is to show you how to embed HTML files in Power BI using R opening the doors for other libraries such as plotly, ggmap and gganimate, among others.</p>
<p>We will use the following libraries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)</code></pre>
