<h3>Colombian Financial System Health (Under Construction)</h3>
<p>Have you ever wonder if the Colombian financial system is healthy? How would you even assess the healthness of the financial system? The following Power BI dashboard allows you to analyze all categories of financial institutions, as well as individual financial institutions, using the main profitability, leverage and liquidity metrics, derived from the principal financial statements, i.e. the balance sheet and the income statement. Although the dashboard is in English, I left the original Spanish names of the institutions and their categories, so apologies if that creates confusion!</p>

<div id="how-to-use-it" class="section level4">
<h4>How to use it?</h4>
<p>This template is connected to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>, which makes it easy to analyze any stock option with real time data. Therefore, you only need to know three things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you don’t want to analyze the ticket selected by default (ARI), go to <em>Data -&gt; Queries &amp; Connections -&gt; Symbol (ARI)</em> and right-click on it. Select <em>Edit</em>, write the symbol of the underlying stock of the option you want to analyze and hit <em>Close &amp; Load Data</em>. Finally hit on the <em>Refresh All</em> button in the Data tab. Don’t worry if the Greeks section throws error messages. This is because the new data may not make sense for the option settled for analysis. This problem should be fixed after the second step.</p></li>
<li><p>In the section <strong>POTENTIAL (OR ACTUAL) TRADE</strong>, input the specifics of your current trade or potential trade that you are trying to analyze.</p></li>
<li><p>The data will update automatically every 15 minutes; however, you can always update by hitting on the <em>Refresh All</em> button in the Data tab.</p></li>
</ol>
