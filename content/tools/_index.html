<h4>How to use it?</h4>
<p>This template is connected to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>, which makes it easy to analyze any stock option with real time data. Therefore, you only need to know three things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you don’t want to analyze the ticket selected by default (ARI), go to <em>Data -&gt; Queries &amp; Connections -&gt; Symbol (ARI)</em> and right-click on it. Select <em>Edit</em>, write the symbol of the underlying stock of the option you want to analyze and hit <em>Close &amp; Load Data</em>. Finally hit on the <em>Refresh All</em> button in the Data tab. Don’t worry if the Greeks section throws error messages. This is because the new data may not make sense for the options settled for analysis. This problem should be fixed after the second step.</p></li>
<li><p>In the section <strong>POTENTIAL (OR ACTUAL) TRADE</strong>, input the specifics of your current trade or potential trade that you are trying to analyze.</p></li>
<li><p>The data will update automatically every 15 minutes; however, you can always update by hitting on the <em>Refresh All</em> button in the Data tab.</p></li>
</ol>
