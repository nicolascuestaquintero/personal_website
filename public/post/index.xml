      <description>Black-Scholes formula for derivatives pricing is at the cornerstone of modern financial theory. It holds at the foundation of Long-Term Capital Management (LCTM), a hedge-fund founded in 1994 under the management of Nobel prizes Robert Merton and Myron Scholes and whose bankruptcy in 1998 during the Rubble crisis almost lead to financial panic, enforcing Federal Reserve intervention. One of its most important applications is estimating implied volatility from options market prices, which works as a benchmark for derivatives pricing and as a measure of market risk.</description>

In R, you can use plotly to add this characteristic to your graphs but using plotly with Power BI default R code compiler leads to an error.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how is the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculated? Many of my colleagues that come from business school understand the concept and how to use it, but when we talk about its calculation all they can think about is doing =IRR(…) or =XIRR(…) in MS Excel. The problem is that the IRR is not that simple and can lead to many problems or mistaken solutions that may fool anyone with a complex cash flow that have no idea what is happening behind scenes.</description>
